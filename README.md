# üéüÔ∏è Event Ticket Forecasting Application  

This project is a collaborative coursework (CSC-40038) aimed at helping an event organizing company forecast ticket sales more accurately.  

The client provided historical datasets of multiple events, and our task was to preprocess the data, test predictive models, and deliver a **user-friendly application** to forecast future ticket sales.
